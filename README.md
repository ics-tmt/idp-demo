## Tests

A set of unit tests for the calculator functions is provided in `test_calculator.py`. To run the tests:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest

## Parity

A simple function `is_even` is provided in `calculator.py` to check if a number is even:

```python
from calculator import is_even
is_even(10)  # True
```

You can also run the interactive checker by executing the script:

```bash
python calculator.py
```
This will prompt you to enter a number and display whether it is even or odd.
```
